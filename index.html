                The cappuccino’s roots trace back to 17th-century Italy, 
                inspired by the color of the robes worn by Capuchin monks — 
                “cappuccio” meaning “hood” in Italian. 
                The mix of espresso, steamed milk, and foam resembled their brown cloaks, 
                giving this beloved drink its name.

                 By the early 1900s, the cappuccino became a symbol of café culture in Europe. 
                Served in porcelain cups with a perfect balance of espresso, milk, and foam, 
                it represented a ritual — a slow, social moment to savor flavor and connection. 
                The invention of the espresso machine only elevated its popularity.
